# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains code solutions, in Python, for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/).

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event in December that features a series of daily programming challenges. Each day, a new problem is released, and participants work to solve it using the programming language of their choice. The challenges are designed to be fun and educational, helping participants improve their coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by day, with each day's solution contained in its own directory. For example:

## Input file
Make sure you have replaced the contents of `input.txt` with the input provided from https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1/input

## How to Run the Code

To run the code for a specific day, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the Python script. For example, to run the solution for Day 1:

```sh
cd day1
python calculate-distance.py
```
